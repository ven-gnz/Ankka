# Ankka

Animation library for learning purposes. Studying under the guidance of Dunsky & Szauer.

Will be kept public, but please do note that I do not own the initial code, and the repo will likely contain elements outside of my IP, which are published under MIT license.

Please also note : I am in no way affiliated with the authors, and have simply opted for a public repo due to mostly seeking to develop this engine further after I am done with the book.
For this reason, I thought this would be labeled under fair use.
